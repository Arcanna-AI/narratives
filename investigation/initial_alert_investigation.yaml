name: "Initial Alert Investigation"
description: |
  This Narrative provides an end-to-end initial investigation to increase confidence in whether or not the initial alert in question requires deep-dive review and remediation. Generally this would be applied to an alert that (on its own) can't easily be identified as malicious or benign.

  # Alert Investigation Protocol
  This document outlines procedures for investigating alert "${alert_id}" (referred to as "the alert" throughout).

  ## Initial Alert Analysis

  If it hasn't already been collected, collect the following information about the alert:
  - Alert type and data source category (endpoint, network, email, etc.)
  - MITRE ATT&CK tactics identified (if none, tell the user *and* identify what the likeliest tactics are and why)
  - Vendor confidence level
  - Alert summary (create one if not provided)
  - Associated artifacts (files, processes, arguments, etc.)
  - User context information
  - Host information (must include host name)

  ## Triage Decision

  Check Arcanna's decision for this alert:
  - Retrieve the Decision name from Arcanna if it is not already present
  - If Arcanna's decision is "Drop" (or a similar negative label) with confidence score ≥50%, proceed directly to Final Report. Do not collect additional context.
  - Otherwise, continue with the full investigation

  ## CRITICAL ALERT LIMIT:
  - **MANDATORY RULE**: After each step, count and explicitly state the total number of alerts gathered.
  - **HARD STOP CONDITION**: Upon reaching or exceeding 10 total alerts, you MUST IMMEDIATELY:
    1. Stop all data collection
    2. Skip directly to the Attack Chain Analysis section
    3. Clearly inform the user: "Investigation shortened to prevent token limit issues."
    4. Do NOT process or gather any further information under any circumstances
    5. Include recommendations for the user to complete remaining steps manually

  ## Additional Guidelines:
  - Ensure all HTML content displays clearly on dark backgrounds.
  - Create a Generated Report artifact only for the Final Report.

  ## Related Alert Investigation

  1. **Host-Based TTPs Context**: Analyze alerts on the same host with matching MITRE ATT&CK tactics from the past 7 days relative to the alert’s timestamp
     - If no MITRE ATT&CK tactics were known, let the user know and move to Artifact-Based Context
     - When creating your query, exclude the original alert (by its ID)
     - Limit to 5 most recent alerts if more exist
     - Note volume and timespan of excluded alerts if limit reached

  2. **Host-Based Time-Grouped Context**: Analyze a limited number of alerts on the same host within ±3 days relative to the alert’s timestamp
     - When creating your query, exclude all collected alerts (by their IDs)
     - Limit to 5 most recent alerts if more exist
     - If the time range and query was already performed as part of Host-Based TTPs Context, do not repeat the query and let the user know why. Otherwise, continue.
     - Exclude the original alert
     - Note volume and timespan of excluded alerts if limit reached

  3. **Artifact-Based Context**: Identify other hosts affected by the same artifact within ±1 hour
     - When creating your query, exclude all collected alerts (by their IDs)
     - Limit to 5 alerts if more exist
     - Document total affected systems and alert count
     - Note if limit reached

  4. **Indicator Reputation Context**: If there are any indicators (such as file hashes, domain names, and IP addresses) – and if we have access to tools that can provide reputation information about these indicators, perform reputation checks and analyze the results
     - Do not repeat these checks if information is already included in our context
     - Limit to 3 total checks
     - Note if limit reached
     - Exclude any internal IP addresses
     - Exclude private or internal domain names
     - Exclude well-known domains
     - Only analyze one file hash per file
     - Document any suspicious or malicious findings

  5. **Attack Chain Analysis**: Evaluate if the sequence suggests an active attack
     - Consider MITRE ATT&CK progression
     - Assess relationship between alerts
     - Determine attack likelihood

  # Final Report
    - Create everything between here and the Feedback section as a Generated Report artifact.
    - Include all unique alerts from this Investigation within the Timeline and Related Alerts sections.

  ## A.) Summary
  ### [Qualitative risk score]
    - Use HTML, CSS, and Javascript only
    - Qualitative risk scores are High Risk, Medium Risk, Low Risk
    - Create a rounded rectangle filled with red (High Risk), yellow (Medium Risk), or green (Low Risk)
    - Qualitative risk score should be in white font and be centered inside the rectangle
    - Height should be similar to the heading
    - Center the rectangle on the screen

  ### [Concise summary of the activity]
  ### Executive Summary: [Max 2 paragraphs]
  ### Recommended Actions: [Bulleted list]

  ## B.) Timeline
  [Vertical chronological timeline of all alert activity discovered]
    - Use HTML, CSS, and Javascript only
    - Make sure that the HTML is correctly rendered
    - Include all alerts associated with this attack
    - Identify ATT&CK tactics
    - Group similar alerts occurring in sequence
    - Identify which hosts caused the alerts
    - Highlight the original alert


  ## C.) Related Alerts
  | Alert ID | Event Summary | Arcanna's Decision | Arcanna's Confidence | Assistant's Opinion | Rationale |
  |:----------:|:-----------|:--------------------:|:-----------------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------|
  | [Truncated IDs] | [concise alert summary] | [dot using proper color for decision label + Decision] | [Confidence as Low/Medium/High, do not show percentage] | [dot using proper color for decision label + Decision] | [Brief explanation, justify why disagreeing with Arcanna if relevant] |
    - Highlight the original alert
    - Add a visible border between rows
